Where My Friends
======


About
------

Where My Friends is android open source app that helps you find where your friends are.
It is paranoiac-friendly: it gives you full access to who and when can see your location. It logs all accesses to your location.

No data is stored on server. Server is needed only to "wake up" your friend's Android to send you location.
Server sources are included as well, you are free to set up your own server.


Build
------

The source of truth to build the project is in IntelliJ project config. Maven's pom.xml-s are used only to maintain dependencies.
