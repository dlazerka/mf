# Privacy Policy

Find Us is a system designed for privacy and security. Privacy is at the core of the service, so it's natural that we have the most strict (and short!) privacy policy among similar services.

## Personal Information

### Location data
Find Us does not store user location data on any durable storage.

Find Us shares user's location information only with parties that are explicitly authorized by user.

Find Us does not share location data to any party user did not explicitly authorize.

### Other personal data
Find Us collects only information required for providing service (for example, email address is used to authenticate users). Find Us does not share this information with any third-parties.

If user gave Find Us permission to access device contact list, Find Us does not transmit the contact list anywhere. Find Us uses user's contact list data only to provide declared service, and does not share, nor collect the contact list data on its servers.

Find Us does not share user's data with any third-parties.

## Security
